# Backbase Devops Assignments

Firstly, thanks for applying for a role in our team! We appreciate you taking the time to do these exercises. Hopefully they'll give you an idea of what our team does and be a little fun along the way.

This repo contains exercises which are relevant to our various work-streams, you may be suited to some areas more than others. Feel free to pick which assignment you would like to work on. If you want to do more than one then thats fine but this is absolutely **not** expected or required (one good assignment is better than 2 mediocre ones!). Some assignments contain optional steps which should be completed if you are applying for more senior positions.

## Writing

Use tools most appropriate to the task at hand and don't re-invent the wheel! You are not limited to using a single tool, language or technique.

When writing your code please try to be as realistic as possible. It should have appropriate comments, commit messages and any unusual design choices should be briefly explained. You should try to follow industry standard best practices whenever possible and always include a `README.md`.

All code submitted should be syntactically correct but it's acceptable to have comments or pseudo-code where actual code is not possible (eg uploading to third-parties). Seeing how you approach problems is just as important as your code.

## Submitting

When submitting your completed assignments, we strongly prefer access to a private github repo (these are free). We'll let you know who you need to give access to (here's [how](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)). If this is not possible then email your git repo (as a zip file) to your contact in our recruitment team.

Please do **not** raise PRs against this repo.

## Feedback

Your contact in our recruitment team will be in touch with feedback on any submitted assignments. It's also important that we get your feedback, regardless on how your application progresses. Please feedback any comments around the assignments (including how long you spend working on it) to our recruitment team.
